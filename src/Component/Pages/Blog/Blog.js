                        <p>SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores. This makes relational SQL databases a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for legacy systems that were built for a relational structure.</p>

                        <p>JWT or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.</p>
                        <p>JWT differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</p>

                        <p>NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue. </p>
